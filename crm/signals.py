"""Signal wiring for the Django → Asterisk realtime sync layer.

Every product-model mutation that should reflect in Asterisk flows through
this module. Handlers:

* ``post_save`` / ``post_delete`` on :class:`crm.models.UserPhoneAssignment`
  → sync/tombstone the pjsip endpoint + auth + aor rows.
* ``post_save`` / ``post_delete`` on :class:`crm.models.Trunk`
  → sync/tombstone the provider-trunk endpoint + registration rows.
* ``post_save`` / ``post_delete`` on :class:`crm.models.Queue`
  → sync/tombstone the queue + its members.
* ``post_save`` / ``post_delete`` on :class:`crm.models.InboundRoute`
  → no-op at DB level (see ``sync_inbound_route`` docstring), but the signal
  is still wired so a later realtime dialplan layer only needs to flip the
  service method, not re-hook signals.
* ``m2m_changed`` on ``User.tenant_groups.through`` → resync queue members
  for every queue backed by the affected group.

All handlers resolve the current tenant via ``connection.schema_name`` (set
by the tenant-schemas middleware), build an ``AsteriskStateSync`` and call
the matching method. Errors are swallowed inside ``AsteriskStateSync._run``
so product CRUD never crashes because of a realtime-DB hiccup.
